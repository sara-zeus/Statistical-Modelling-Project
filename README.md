# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
This project involves applying Python skills to handle data from APIs, clean and transform it, perform exploratory data analysis, build statistical models, and present findings effectively.

## Process

The main processes involved in the project, outlined in bullet points:

1. **Accessing data using APIs**
2. **Cleaning and transforming data using Python**
3. **Loading data into a database using Python**
4. **Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with statistics and visualizations**
5. **Identifying trends and patterns in data using statistical models**
6. **Interpreting the results obtained from the statistical models**
7. **Creating a README.md file for project overview**
8. **Completing four Jupyter notebooks:** 
   - `city_bikes.ipynb`
   - `yelp_foursquareEDA.ipynb`
   - `joining_data.ipynb`
   - `model_building.ipynb`
9. **Structuring a concise presentation covering:**
   - Project flow
   - Results demonstration
   - Regression model explanation
   - Model outputs
   - Challenges faced
   - Potential improvements with more time.
